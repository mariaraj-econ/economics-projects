# Economics Projects

This repository contains small, self-contained projects where I practice economic analysis and data visualization using **Python** and **R**.  
The focus is on **macroeconomics, business cycles, and monetary policy**.

### Upcoming Projects
1. ðŸ“ˆ **GDP & Unemployment Trends (Denmark)** â€” basic time-series visualization using Statistics Denmark data.
2. ðŸ”® **Inflation & Output Gap Analysis** â€” simple regression exploring relationships over time.

Each project includes:
- Data source  
- Short economic interpretation  
- Code in a Jupyter notebook or R script
